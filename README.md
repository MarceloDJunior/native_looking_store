An app that uses Cupertino theme on IOS and Material theme on Android, for native look and feel in each platform.

The base project was created during the <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-cupertino">Building a Cupertino app with Flutter</a> codelab.

The custom platform aware widgets implement a <strong>Platform-specific Widget Factory</strong>, proposed in this <a href="https://medium.com/flutter/do-flutter-apps-dream-of-platform-aware-widgets-7d7ed7b4624d">article</a> by Swav Kulinski.
